# Do Stars Spin? 3

## We are given the following description: 

PMP was walking by earlier, muttering something about "stars". I think he's said something about it before. I also want to know: do stars spin? I'd search for it, but I'm too busy. I think he's mentioned something about stars somewhereâ€¦help me out? [continued]

## The Challenge

Continuing on from the second challenge, we need to expand on the OSINT details we found. In this case, we need to review the details posted on the Twitter profile. We found that the person had tweeted "got banned from 1 TFES forum but not the other". I googled and found 2 "The Flat Earth Society" forums, but one needed a login, so I ignored that one. I opted to search for "stars" and only look for posts in the last month. Luckily there wasn't much to comb through, and I found a similar username: starsspinning. After looking at this persons profile, they had a post to email them at "starsspinning123@gmail.com". 

When sending this account an email, it has an auto responder that says to contact them via a hangouts group. After joining the hangouts group, the flag is the name of the group.
