# Do Stars Spin? 1

##We are given the following description: 

PMP was walking by earlier, muttering something about "stars". I think he's said something about it before. I also want to know: do stars spin? I'd search for it, but I'm too busy. I think he's mentioned something about stars somewhereâ€¦help me out?

##We are given the following hints: 
1) Where can you look to see what PMP has said before?
2) How do you view archived/deleted content?
3) Read the chal description!

## The Challenge

Since this is an OSINT challenge, step 1 is to google anything we are given. In this case, I googled "dostarsspin" "do stars spin" "spinning stars". I was able to find an instagram account, which had social media links for twitter, reddit, and snapchat. We will want to check each account, but for this challenge, the reddit account is where we land. When you view the account, you can see there are deleted comments on the post, so we will want to "undelete" those. You can use the wayback machine, on the users profile, to find the flag for this challenge.
