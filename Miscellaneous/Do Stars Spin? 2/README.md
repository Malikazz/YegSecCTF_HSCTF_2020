# Do Stars Spin? 2

## We are given the following description: 

PMP was walking by earlier, muttering something about "stars". I think he's said something about it before. I also want to know: do stars spin? I'd search for it, but I'm too busy. I think he's mentioned something about stars somewhereâ€¦help me out? [continued]

## The Challenge

Continuing on from the first challenge, we need to expand on the OSINT details we found. In this case, we need to review the rest of the social media profiles. Challenge 1 was the reddit account, but we still have instagram and twitter left. When going to the Instagram account, we found some good memes, but nothing more; this leaves Twitter as the place to be. After investigating twitter, we have found a few links to some Wikipedia pages. 

When visiting the Wikipedia pages, we want to see why this person referenced it. If you click "View History", we find that the page was edited by "Dostarsspin", which is quite similar to the other usernames. As such, we want to see what changes they have made, so we click "contribs" to see where they have contributed. Their contributions include a change to the "Flag" page which gives us the flag if you check the diff.
